Overview  
The goal of this project is to develop a sophisticated Chess game that includes all the intricate rules such as En Passant, Castling, and Pawn Promotion. Additionally, the project aims to integrate an AI model capable of making intelligent Chess moves. The Chess game will be built with a user-friendly interface for ease of interaction.

Key Features:     
1.Full implementation of Chess rules including En Passant, Castling, and Pawn Promotion.                                                                  
2.A visually appealing user interface to display the Chess board and enable user interaction.        
3.Implementation of a robust AI model using advanced algorithms to make intelligent Chess moves.          

Project Components:

Chess Game Implementation:  
Design and creation of the Chess board representation.
Incorporation of the movement rules for all Chess pieces, including special cases such as Castling and En Passant.
Management of game state to track player turns and game conditions (e.g., check, checkmate, stalemate).
Implementation of the Pawn Promotion feature to handle pawn upgrades to other pieces upon reaching the opposite end of the board.

User Interface Development:  
Creation of a user-friendly interface to display the Chess board and facilitate player moves.
Integration of intuitive controls for users to interact with the game seamlessly.
Design of an engaging and visually appealing graphical interface for an enhanced user experience.

AI Model Integration:   
Incorporation of the Minimax algorithm for decision-making in the AI.
Implementation of Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize the AI decision-making process.
Development of a heuristic evaluation function to assess board positions and determine the best possible moves for the AI.
Training and fine-tuning of the AI model using historical Chess data to enhance its strategic decision-making capabilities.
